# range-search


In its most general form, the range searching problem consists of preprocessing
a set S of objects, in order to determine which objects from S intersect with
a query object, called a range.
For example, S may be a set of points corresponding to the coordinates of several cities,
and we want to find the cities within a certain latitude and longitude range.
